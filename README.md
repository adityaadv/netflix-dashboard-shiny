Capstone Project of Netflix dataset using Shiny Apps.

This is a dashboard I made as a part of the Capstone Project assignment fufilment from the Data Visualization Specialization Course from Algorit.ma . The purpose of this dashboard is to provide exploratory analysis regarding the movies and tv shows that are available in Netflix platform. The data that is used within the dashboard is sourced from Kaggle by the data owner, Shivam Bansal.

The flow of this dashboard is from the overview of the insight including the growth of Netflix content by year and percentage of the contents compared by TV Shows and Movies. Further, the distribution of Netflix Contents by groups, and several insights will be provided in the next panel. Lastly, the links and networks between casts and directors are shown in the last panel. For more information about the code, please checkout the 'View Code' panel. Happy Exploring~
